# `init` command

## Usage

```
nf-test init
```

The `init` command set ups nf-test in the current directory.

The `init` command creates the following files: `nf-test.config` and `tests/nextflow.config`. It also creates a folder `tests` which is the home directory of your test code.

In the [configuration](/configuration.md) section you can learn more about these files and how to customize the directory layout.
