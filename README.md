# :rocket: nf-test

> Simple test framework for Nextflow pipelines
The full documentation can be found [here](https://code.askimed.com/nf-test).

## Installation

nf-test has the same requirements as Nextflow and can be used on POSIX compatible systems like Linux or OS X. You can install nf-test using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code.askimed.com/install/nf-test | bash
```

If you don't have curl installed, you could use wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://code.askimed.com/install/nf-test | bash
```

It will create the `nf-test` executable file in the current directory. Optionally, move the `nf-test` file to a directory accessible by your `$PATH` variable.

### Conda

To install this package from Bioconda run the following command:

```
conda install -c bioconda nf-test
```

*Note: this recipe is not maintained by us.*

### Compile from source
To compile nf-test from source you shall have maven installed. This will produce a `nf-test/target/nf-test.jar` file.
```
git clone git@github.com:askimed/nf-test.git
cd nf-test
mvn install
```
To use the newly compiled `nf-test.jar`, update the `nf-test` bash script that is on your PATH to point to the new `.jar` file.
First locate it with `which nf-test`, and then modify `APP_HOME` and `APP_JAR` vars at the top:
```
#!/bin/bash
APP_HOME="/PATH/TO/nf-test/target/"
APP_JAR="nf-test.jar"
APP_UPDATE_URL="https://code.askimed.com/install/nf-test"
...
```

## Usage

```
